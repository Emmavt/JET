Planet surface gravity (in m/s^-2):
11.8938255708
Planet radius (in m): -- This is the planet's radius at the base of the atmosphere (or at the cloud top for cloudy calculations)
11117091.048
Star radius (in m):
664210140.0
Pressure of cloud top (in Pa), -- or leave at 0.0 if you want no cloud calculations.
10000.0.0
Rayleigh scattering augmentation factor -- default is 1.0.  Can be increased to simulate additional sources of scattering.  0.0 turns off Rayleigh scattering.
